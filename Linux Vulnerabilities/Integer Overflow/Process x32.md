# Integer Overflow in a Userspace C Program (Ubuntu 32-bit)

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates an **Integer Overflow vulnerability (CWE-190)** in a C program on Ubuntu. It shows how unchecked memory allocation can lead to **heap buffer overflows**, causing crashes or security risks.

---

## Objectives

- Trigger an integer overflow in memory allocation
- Analyze the crash using GDB/Valgrind
- Apply a fix with proper bounds checking

3. Using Valgrind for Deeper Memory Checks

```bash
valgrind ./int_overflow
```

```bash
time ./int_overflow_safe
```
