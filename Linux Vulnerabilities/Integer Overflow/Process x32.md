# Integer Overflow in a Userspace C Program (Ubuntu 32-bit)

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates an **Integer Overflow vulnerability (CWE-190)** in a C program on Ubuntu. It shows how unchecked memory allocation can lead to **heap buffer overflows**, causing crashes or security risks.

---

## Objectives

- Trigger an integer overflow in memory allocation
- Analyze the crash using GDB/Valgrind
- Apply a fix with proper bounds checking


---
## Project Overflow

1. Creation of the Integer Overflow Vulnerability:

---

2. View the performance of the kernel module before clearing out the vulnerability:

```bash
time ./int_overflow_safe
```
Enter number of integers to allocate: 
```bash
1073741825
```
   ![Capture 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d847d8a6-5b0d-47a6-b585-f965d76a9528)

---

3. Run and Trigger overflow in GDB:

4. Using Valgrind for Deeper Memory Checks

```bash
valgrind ./int_overflow
```

## Performance 

This section demonstrates the comparison of the performance before and after applying a proper safety check.

## üìÇ File Structure

- `int_overflow.c` ‚Äì Vulnerable code that leads to a segmentation fault due to unchecked integer overflow.
- `int_overflow_safe.c` ‚Äì Secure version that detects the overflow and exits safely.

## üß™ Input Used

```text
Enter number of integers to allocate: 1073741825
