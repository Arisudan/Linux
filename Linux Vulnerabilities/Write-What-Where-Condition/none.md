Thanks for pointing that out. The error `workload error: no such directory` typically means that `perf` can't find or run the program you've specified—most likely due to one of these reasons:

---

### ✅ **Checklist to Fix the Error**

1. **Ensure the file is compiled and exists**
   Run this to compile your file:

   ```bash
   gcc www_vuln.c -o www_vuln
   ```

   Then check if the binary is present:

   ```bash
   ls -l ./www_vuln
   ```

2. **Run `perf` with correct path**

   If you're inside the directory with `www_vuln`, this works:

   ```bash
   sudo perf stat -e cycles,instructions,cache-misses ./www_vuln > vuln_perf.txt
   ```

   **Avoid using absolute paths that don’t exist**, e.g., don’t do this unless correct:

   ```bash
   sudo perf stat -e ... /home/user/does/not/exist/www_vuln  # ❌ will fail
   ```

3. **Make sure the binary is executable**

   If needed, set the executable bit:

   ```bash
   chmod +x www_vuln
   ```

4. **You’re not accidentally giving a directory name**

   Make sure you’re not giving `perf` a directory name instead of an executable file.

### ✅ Summary Command That Should Work

If you're in the directory where `www_vuln` is located and it’s compiled:

```bash
sudo perf stat -e cycles,instructions,cache-misses ./www_vuln > vuln_perf.txt
```

Thank you for the image, Arisudan. The error:

```
fatal error: linux/module.h: No such file or directory
```

means you're trying to compile **Linux kernel module code** using `gcc` as if it's a normal userspace program, which **won’t work**.

---

### ✅ Here's how to fix it:

#### 🔧 You must compile it as a **kernel module**, not a regular C program.

---

### 🛠 Steps to Compile `www_vuln.c` as a Kernel Module:

#### 1. **Install kernel headers (if not installed)**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
```

---

#### 2. **Create a Makefile**

In the same folder as `www_vuln.c`, create a file named `Makefile` with:

```makefile
obj-m += www_vuln.o

all:
	make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build M=$(PWD) modules

clean:
	make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build M=$(PWD) clean
```

---

#### 3. **Build the Module**

Run:

```bash
make
```

You should see a file like `www_vuln.ko` created — this is your **kernel module**.

---

#### 4. **Insert and Remove the Module**

To insert:

```bash
sudo insmod www_vuln.ko
```

To check:

```bash
dmesg | tail
```

To remove:

```bash
sudo rmmod www_vuln
```
