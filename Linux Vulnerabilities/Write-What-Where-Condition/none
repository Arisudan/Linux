Thanks for pointing that out. The error `workload error: no such directory` typically means that `perf` can't find or run the program you've specified—most likely due to one of these reasons:

### ✅ **Checklist to Fix the Error**

1. **Ensure the file is compiled and exists**
   Run this to compile your file:

   ```bash
   gcc www_vuln.c -o www_vuln
   ```

   Then check if the binary is present:

   ```bash
   ls -l ./www_vuln
   ```

2. **Run `perf` with correct path**

   If you're inside the directory with `www_vuln`, this works:

   ```bash
   sudo perf stat -e cycles,instructions,cache-misses ./www_vuln > vuln_perf.txt
   ```

   **Avoid using absolute paths that don’t exist**, e.g., don’t do this unless correct:

   ```bash
   sudo perf stat -e ... /home/user/does/not/exist/www_vuln  # ❌ will fail
   ```

3. **Make sure the binary is executable**

   If needed, set the executable bit:

   ```bash
   chmod +x www_vuln
   ```

4. **You’re not accidentally giving a directory name**

   Make sure you’re not giving `perf` a directory name instead of an executable file.

### ✅ Summary Command That Should Work

If you're in the directory where `www_vuln` is located and it’s compiled:

```bash
sudo perf stat -e cycles,instructions,cache-misses ./www_vuln > vuln_perf.txt
```
