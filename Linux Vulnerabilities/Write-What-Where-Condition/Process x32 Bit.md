# Write-What-Where Condition in a Linux Kernel Module (Ubuntu 32-bit)

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a **Write-What-Where Condition vulnerability (CWE-123)** in a Linux kernel module on Ubuntu. It shows how uncontrolled writes from userspace can overwrite kernel pointers, allowing arbitrary memory writes.

## Objectives

- Trigger a Write-What-Where condition in kernel memory
- Analyze the vulnerability using `dmesg` or GDB
- Apply a fix using proper validation and memory protection techniques

## Conclusion: 

After clearing the CWE-123 vulnerability, minor improvements were observed in **context switching** and **execution time**, indicating a slightly more efficient and stable system.
