# ðŸ“ˆ 32-bit Buffer Overflow Performance Analysis

This document outlines the steps and results for measuring the performance of a **buffer overflow vulnerability** in a Linux kernel module on a **32-bit (i386)** system.

---

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Set Up the Environment
Ensure your system supports 32-bit builds:
```bash
sudo apt install gcc-multilib
```

### 2. Compile the Vulnerable Program
Use the following command to compile for 32-bit:
```bash
gcc -m32 -fno-stack-protector -z execstack stack_overflow.c -o stack_overflow32
```
- `-m32`: Targets 32-bit architecture
- `-fno-stack-protector`: Disables stack protection
- `-z execstack`: Makes the stack executable

### 3. Prepare for Measurement
Allow access to performance counters:
```bash
sudo sh -c 'echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid'
```

### 4. Run Before Triggering Overflow
Measure safe input execution time:
```bash
time echo "SAFE_INPUT" | sudo tee /dev/vuln > /dev/null
```
Install "perf" using the below command in Linux
```bash
apt-get install linux-tools-common linux-tools-generic linux-tools-`uname -r`
```
And with `perf`:
```bash
perf stat echo "SAFE_INPUT" | sudo tee /dev/vuln > /dev/null
```

### 5. Run After Triggering Overflow
Send overflow input:
```bash
time echo "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA" | sudo tee /dev/vuln > /dev/null
```
```bash
perf stat echo "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA" | sudo tee /dev/vuln > /dev/null
```

## ðŸ“Š Performance Table (Example)

| Condition        | Real Time | User Time | Sys Time | Instructions | Cycles | Notes                            |
|------------------|-----------|-----------|----------|--------------|--------|----------------------------------|
| Before Overflow  | 0.003s    | 0.001s    | 0.002s   | 9,800        | 3,100  | Normal execution                 |
| After Overflow   | 0.004s    | 0.001s    | 0.003s   | 10,900       | 3,200  | Return address may be corrupted |

## âœ… Conclusion

- 32-bit systems often run faster for small tasks due to simpler memory models.
- Instruction count and cycles are lower than 64-bit, but with architectural limits.
- Testing overflow behavior helps understand how control flow changes.
